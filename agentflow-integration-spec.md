## System Architecture Overview

### Current Architecture

The React Video Editor Pro v7.0.0 is currently deployed as a standalone Next.js application on Vercel with the following technical stack:

- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js 14 with React 18 and TypeScript
- **UI Components:** Tailwind CSS with Shadcn/UI component library
- **State Management:** React Context API with custom hooks
- **Video Processing:** Client-side video manipulation using Web APIs
- **AI Services:** OpenAI Whisper API for subtitle generation
- **Media Assets:** Pexels API for stock video and image content
- **Storage:** Supabase for user data and project persistence
- **Deployment:** Vercel with automatic GitHub integration

### Target Integration Architecture

The integration with AgentFlow requires a hybrid architecture that maintains the video editor's functionality while seamlessly embedding it within the AgentFlow platform. The proposed architecture consists of three primary components:

**1. AgentFlow Host Application**
The main AgentFlow platform serves as the host environment, providing user authentication, project management, and navigation. This application maintains its existing React + TypeScript + Vite stack while incorporating the video editor as an embedded module.

**2. Video Editor Module**
The video editor operates as a self-contained module within the AgentFlow ecosystem. It maintains its own state management and rendering pipeline while communicating with the host application through a well-defined API interface. The module includes:

- Video timeline management and editing controls
- AI-powered subtitle generation and customization
- Media asset management and integration
- Real-time preview and playback capabilities
- Export and rendering functionality

**3. Rendering Service**
A dedicated cloud-based rendering service handles the computationally intensive task of video compilation and export. This service operates independently of the client-side application, ensuring consistent performance regardless of user device capabilities.

### Communication Flow

The integration follows a polling-based communication pattern similar to the established carousel generation workflow:

1. **Initialization:** AgentFlow initiates video editor session via POST request
2. **Project Management:** Continuous synchronization of project state through GET/PUT operations
3. **Rendering Request:** Video compilation triggered via POST request returning job ID
4. **Status Polling:** Regular polling of rendering status until completion
5. **Download Delivery:** Final video URL provided for user download

This architecture ensures loose coupling between components while maintaining data consistency and providing a responsive user experience.

## Video Rendering Pipeline

### Architecture Overview

The video rendering pipeline operates as a distributed system designed to handle computationally intensive video processing tasks without impacting the client-side user experience. The pipeline consists of multiple stages, each optimized for specific aspects of video production.

### Rendering Stages

**Stage 1: Pre-processing and Validation**
Before rendering begins, the system validates all project assets and timeline configurations:

- Asset integrity verification (file corruption checks)
- Timeline consistency validation (no gaps or overlaps)
- Resource availability confirmation (all referenced assets accessible)
- Output format compatibility verification
- Estimated rendering time calculation based on project complexity

**Stage 2: Asset Preparation**
All media assets undergo preparation for the rendering process:

- Video transcoding to consistent intermediate format
- Audio normalization and synchronization
- Subtitle track preparation and timing validation
